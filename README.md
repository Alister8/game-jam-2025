# The root of our beers

## Gameplay loop

Pour drinks and serve them to patrons.

The pouring minigame is a careful balance of rapid mug-filling while avoiding making too many bubbles and not spilling beer

serving the beers requires sliding them to patrons without the beer sliding off the edge of the countertop
